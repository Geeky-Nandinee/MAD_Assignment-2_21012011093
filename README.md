Expense App

1. `TotalExpenditureActivity.kt`:
   - This file defines an Android activity that displays the total expenditure over daily, weekly, or monthly time frames. Users can select a time frame, and the app calculates and shows the total expenditure and a list of expenses for that period.

2. `MainActivity.kt`:
   - This file represents the main activity of the app and features a spinning coin animation. It provides buttons for users to navigate to other parts of the app, such as viewing the total expenditure or adding new expenses.

3. `AddExpenseActivity.kt`:
   - This Kotlin file defines an activity for adding new expenses to the app. It offers input fields for specifying the amount, date, category, and description of expenses. Users can select a category from a dropdown menu and click the "Add Expense" button to save the expense, after which they are directed back to the total expenditure view.

These three files collectively create an expense tracking app that enables users to add, categorize, and review their expenses over different time frames.
